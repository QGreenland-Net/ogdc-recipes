# Greenland Ice Sheet sea-level contribution

This recipe takes NetCDF model outputs from the [Contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea-level over the next millennium using Large Ensemble Simulations, spatial time series, 2008-3007](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A29G5GD39) dataset and converts them to GeoTIFF format in EPSG:3413 projection for use in QGreenland.

The dataset contains ice sheet model projections under three climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) showing Greenland's contribution to global sea-level rise over 1000 years.
